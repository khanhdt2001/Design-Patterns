**State** is a behavioral design pattern that lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed its class.

## Problem
The State pattern is closely related to the concept of a Finite-State Machine. The main idea is that, at any given moment, thereâ€™s a finite number of states which a program can be in. Within any unique state, the program behaves differently, and the program can be switched from one state to another instantaneously. However, depending on a current state, the program may or may not switch to certain other states. These switching rules, called transitions, are also finite and predetermined. _State machines are usually implemented with lots of conditional statements (if or switch) that select the appropriate behavior depending on the current state of the object_


## Solution

The State pattern suggests that you create new classes for all possible states of an object and extract all state-specific behaviors into these classes. Instead of implementing all behaviors on its own, the original object, called context, stores a reference to one of the state objects that represents its current state, and delegates all the state-related work to that object. This is possible only if all state classes follow the same interface and the context itself works with these objects through that interface.
