**Mediator** is a behavioral design pattern that lets you reduce chaotic dependencies between objects. The pattern restricts direct communications between the objects and forces them to collaborate only via a mediator object.

## Problem
Say you have a dialog for creating and editing customer profiles. It consists of various form controls such as text fields, checkboxes, buttons, etc. Some of the form elements may interact with others. By having this logic implemented directly inside the code of the form elements you make these elementsâ€™ classes much harder to reuse in other forms of the app

## Solution 
The Mediator pattern suggests that you should cease all direct communication between the components which you want to make independent of each other. Instead, these components must collaborate indirectly, by calling a special mediator object that redirects the calls to appropriate components. As a result, the components depend only on a single mediator class instead of being coupled to dozens of their colleagues.

## note
Over time a mediator can evolve into a God Object.
